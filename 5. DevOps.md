# Source control with DevOps or Github

Fabric allows you to bind a workspace to a repository in Azure DevOp or Github (not yet available). In this lab, we will set up version control for our workspace.

## Set up the DevOps service

Navigate to [https://aex.dev.azure.com](https://aex.dev.azure.com/) Create a new DevOps org at dev.azure.com. Sign in with your tutorial account. Select "Continue" on the "more details" page. Next, click the "Create new organization" button. Accept the defaults, change the hosting location to "United States", enter the Captcha code, and click "Continue".

Create a new project named "FabricLabs". Leave it as "Private".

Once the project is created, select the "Repos" node. In the bottom section, click the "Initialize" button to create this new repo.

Note that a new column is added to the workspace, "Get status". After a moment, the values in the "Git status" column will be updated. Note that some items are unsupported - this will change over time.

## Deploy Devops changes to the workspace

Navigate back to your Devops repo. Refresh the windows to see the changes.
